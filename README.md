Peer-to-peer (p2p) chat

## About

This is an attempt to create a p2p chat for web that reminds of old-good IRC. The core difference from many alternatives that are around the web is peer-to-peer architecture. In other words, chatting should be completely server-less. This can be done to a level where only server is so called connection broker that doesn't receive any data, but only points one peer to another.

Work in progress. **Star the repo if you would like this to take off!**
